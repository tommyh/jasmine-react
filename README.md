*jasmine-react* is a small suite of helper functions to make unit testing React.js components painless.

# Why do I need jasmine-react.js?

React.js' architecture is based on the idea that mutation is hard, so your React.js components should represent a state machine which can represent your UI under any state.  This is an extremely powerful idea and means that you will often compose components inside of other components.  While this is great for code reuse, it makes isolating one component for a unit test slightly more difficult.  React.js will also provide some very helpful features (like auto binding), which make it more difficult to get under the covers and stub things out.  jasmine-react aims to solve these testing issues.

# Synopsis

Here's an overview of how jasmineReact can be used:

### Spying on a method in a React Class

```javascript
/** @jsx React.DOM */
window.HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  getDefaultProps: function(){
    return { number: this.randomNumber() };
  },
  randomNumber: function(){
    return Math.random();
  },
  render: function() {
    return (<div>Hello {this.props.number}</div>);
  }
});

describe("HelloWorld", function(){
  it("can spy on a function for a React class", function(){
    jasmineReact.spyOnClass(HelloWorld, "randomNumber").andReturn(42);

    // jasmineReact wraps React.renderComponent, so you don't have to worry
    //  about the async nature of when the actual DOM get's rendered, or selecting
    //  where your component needs to get rendered (default is #jasmine_content)
    var myWorld = jasmineReact.renderComponent(<HelloWorld />);

    expect(myWorld.props.number).toBe(42);
  });

  it("can assert that a spy has been called", function(){
    jasmineReact.spyOnClass(HelloWorld, "randomNumber");

    jasmineReact.renderComponent(HelloWorld());

    // because we spy on the class and not the instance, we have to assert that the
    //   function on the class' prototype was called.
    expect(jasmineReact.classPrototype(HelloWorld).randomNumber).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Replacing a component's subcomponent with a test double

This is very helpful for isolating your component tests to just that component, and avoiding
testing its subcomponents.

```javascript
/** @jsx React.DOM */
window.Avatar = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Profile username="Zuck" ref="pic" />
      </div>
    );
  }
});

window.Profile = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    throw("I like to blow up");
  }
});

describe("Avatar", function(){

  it("should spy on a subcomponent and use a test double component", function(){
   jasmineReact.createStubComponent(window, "Profile");

   // This line won't throw the "I like to blow up" error because we've replaced the class with a test double!
   var avatar = jasmineReact.renderComponent(<Avatar />);

   expect(avatar.refs.pic.props.username).toBe("Zuck")
  });

});
```

### Adding a method to a component class

This is needed to make a test double implement an interface which the component under test requires.

```javascript
/** @jsx React.DOM */
window.Avatar = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Profile username="Zuck" ref="pic" />
      </div>
    );
  },

  rotateProfile: function(){
    this.refs.pic.rotate();
  }
});

describe("Avatar", function(){
  describe("rotateProfile", function(){
    it("should call 'rotate' on the Profile subcomponent", function(){
      var profileClassStub = jasmineReact.createStubComponent(window, "Profile");

      // We could also do: jasmineReact.addMethodToClass(window.Profile, "rotate", function(){});
      jasmineReact.addMethodToClass(profileClassStub, "rotate", function(){});
      jasmineReact.spyOnClass(profileClassStub, "rotate");

      var avatar = jasmineReact.renderComponent(<Avatar />);

      expect(jasmineReact.classPrototype(profileClassStub).rotate).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
      avatar.rotateProfile();
      expect(jasmineReact.classPrototype(profileClassStub).rotate).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
```

# API

## jasmineReact.renderComponent

`jasmineReact.renderComponent(component, [container], [callback]);`

When rendering a React component, this is a convenience function for React.renderComponent.

It has a few helpful features:

* the container argument is optional.  By default it will be: `document.getElementById("jasmine_content")
* `React.renderComponent` will return before the rendering has occurred.  `jasmineReact.renderComponent` will wait
  until the async render has been performed.

Just like `React.renderComponent`, this method will return the component instance.


## jasmineReact.spyOnClass

`jasmineReact.spyOnClass(componentClass, functionName);`

When you want to render a component and stub on a function for that component, you need to spyOn the function
before the instance has been created because important functions (default props/state, render) happen during initialization.
This means you need to spyOn the component class, not the component instance.

This function performs the following:

* uses the vanilla `jasmine.spyOn` to spy on the component class prototype
* React does some performance tricks for [autobinding functions](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/07/02/react-v0-4-autobind-by-default.html),
  so this function will abstract those away from you
* returns a regular jasmine spy object, so you can chain additional spy functions onto it.
  For example: `jasmineReact.spyOnClass(Avatar, "getWidth").andCallFake(function(){ return 120; });`

## jasmineReact.classPrototype

`jasmineReact.classPrototype(componentClass)`

After you've spied on a component class using `jasmineReact.spyOnClass`, you will need to assert things
on that component class.  This function returns you the object you want to make your assertions against.

```js
jasmineReact.spyOnClass(Avatar, "getWidth");

var myAvatar = jasmineReact.renderComponent(<Avatar />);
myAvatar.getWidth();

expect(jasmineReact.classPrototype(Avatar).getWidth).toHaveBeenCalled();

// NOTE: your jasmine-fu will want todo this, but you can't:
// expect(myAvatar.getWidth).toHaveBeenCalled(); <-- DON'T DO THIS
```

## jasmineReact.createStubComponent

`jasmineReact.createStubComponent(namespace, className)`

React components are intended to be composable (using one component inside a render function of another component). While this is great for code reuse, it makes isolating one component for a unit test slightly more difficult.

  *Aside: Why do I want to isolate the component I'm testing from its subcomponents? In a unit test, when you test one component you do want to have to test the behavior of a subcomponent, because that would turn into an integration test.*

What you want todo is replace any subcomponent's real definition with a "test double". By default this stub component has only the miniumum behavior to be a valid React component: a render function which returns a dom node.

If you want to add behavior to this stubComponent, so it confirms to the interface of the real component class, use the `jasmineReact.addMethodToClass` function.

Let's say you have an avatar class named `ProfilePic` which is defined on the global namespace, `window`.
To replace window.ProfilePic with a stub component (for the life of the jasmine test), you would do:

```js
jasmineReact.createStubComponent(window, "ProfilePic");
```

## jasmineReact.setDisplayNameForClass

`jasmineReact.setDisplayNameForClass(componentClass, newDisplayName);`

When React throws a validation error for a component, `Invariant Violation`, it will include in the error message the variable
name for the component instance, ie the display name.  While this behavior is very helpful for developing, it can make your tests a bit tricky --
property validations defined in mixins, `anyonomous` display names, shared specs, etc.

This function allows you to set the display name for a component class, so the error messages you want to assert against
are a bit more predictable.

```js
jasmineReact.setDisplayNameForClass(Avatar, "avatarDisplayName");

expect(function(){
  jasmineReact.renderComponent(<Avatar enlarge='true' />);
}).toThrow("Invariant Violation: Invalid prop `enlarge` of type `string` supplied to `avatarDisplayName`, expected `boolean`.");
}
```


## jasmineReact.unmountComponent

`jasmineReact.unmountComponent(component);`

This function makes it easy to unmount a component, given just the component instance.
Unmounting a component is needed to test `componentWillUnmount` behavior.

```js
var myAvatar = jasmineReact.renderComponent(<Avatar />);
jasmineReact.unmountComponent(myAvatar);
```

## jasmineReact.getJasmineContent

After each test, it is imperative that jasmineReact clean up after itself so that one test doesn't pollute the next.
One step in this process, is making sure that any component rendered gets unmounted.  By default, in a jasmine suite
all DOM elements should be a child of the `#jasmine_content` div.  If that is true for you, then you won't need to use
this function.  But if you use some other div to render your jasmine DOM, then you'll want to redefine this function to
meet your specification.

If your jasmine test page, uses `#spec-dom` as its dom node, then you'd want to define the following:

```js
jasmineReact.getJasmineContent = function(){
  return document.getElementById("spec-dom");
};
```

## jasmineReact.TestUtils

This is not a function. It's simply an extra property on jasmineReact that will reference React.addons.TestUtils if you're using react-with-addons.js instead of react.js. See http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html for api reference.


# Installation

To install, include the `src/jasmine-react.js` file in your jasmine spec helpers list.


# Testing

This project uses jasmine for its automated tests.

Right now it has 2 seperate builds: core tests, documentation tests.

To run the tests, open the following files in your browser:

* `jasmine-react/test/index.html`
* `jasmine-react/test/documentation.html`

Note: if you run these tests without a server, `documentation.html` will fail in Chrome due to a `file://` jsx issue.






# TODO

* use grunt.js for automated build, minification, etc
* Travis CI
* browserify/requirejs compatablility
